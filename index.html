						<div class="widget-main">
							<p>The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software.The license was originally written by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU Project, and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition. </br>
							The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derivative work can only be distributed under the same license terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.</br>
							The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>

							<h2>GNU - What is the Free Software Movement?</h2>
						</header>

						<div class="widget-main">
							<p>GNU is an operating system that is free software—that is, it respects users' freedom. The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom.
							</br>
							The free software movement campaigns to win for the users of computing the freedom that comes from free software. Free software puts its users in control of their own computing. Non-free software puts its users under the power of the software's developer. See the video explanation.
							The name “GNU” is a recursive acronym for “GNU's Not Unix.” “GNU” is pronounced g'noo, as one syllable, like saying “grew” but replacing the r with n.<br/>
							In 1998 the term “open source” was coined and associated with views considerably different from ours. These views cite only the practical advantages of free software, and carefully avoid the deeper issues of freedom and social solidarity that the Free Software Movement raises.
							</br>The idea of open source is good as far as it goes, but it only scratches the surface of the issue.</br> We don't mind working with supporters of open source on practical activities such as software development, but we do not agree with their views, and we decline to operate under their name.</p>

							<h2>Create your own license</h2>
						</header>

						<div class="widget-main">
							<p>Open an editor.</br>
							Write terms of license.</br>
							Save file.</br>
							Include in project.</br>
							Generally speaking, that's all there is to it. Seriously.</br>

							Don't believe me? Check out Phil Sturgeon's Don't Be A Dick license (as well as the WTFPL that inspired it).</br>

							That said, it's hit or miss whether software licenses are legally enforceable, even if a lawyer wrote them (at least in the US, and it depends almost entirely on the whim of the judge or ruling copyright authority). More generally, though, as the software author, you are already covered by your country's copyright laws (assuming you've taken the steps for your work to be copyrighted; in the US, that's simply actually making the work).
