						</header>

						<div class="widget-main">
							<p>Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) included in Anaconda® distribution that allows you to launch applications and easily manage conda packages, environments and channels without using command-line commands. Navigator can search for packages on Anaconda Cloud or in a local Anaconda Repository. It is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.
							 </br>
							The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derivative work can only be distributed under the same license terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.</br>
							In order to run, many scientific packages depend on specific versions of other packages. Data scientists often use multiple versions of many packages, and use multiple environments to separate these different versions.

							The command line program conda is both a package manager and an environment manager, to help data scientists ensure that each version of each package has all the dependencies it requires and works correctly.

							Navigator is an easy, point-and-click way to work with packages and environments without needing to type conda commands in a terminal window. You can use it to find the packages you want, install them in an environment, run the packages and update them, all inside Navigator.</p>

							<p>Eclipse provides IDEs and platforms for nearly every language and architecture. We are famous for our Java IDE, C/C++, JavaScript and PHP IDEs built on extensible platforms for creating desktop, Web and cloud IDEs. These platforms deliver the most extensive collection of add-on tools available for software developers.

							<p>Fritzing is installed with a Parts Library--and with every new release we are adding new parts.  In Fritzing, parts are organized into "bins" which can be accessed from the parts palette on the right. Simply drag a part on the sketch area to use it, and then adapt its properties in the info palette. Learn more about Fritzing's palettes.</br>

							Fritzing ships with several bins.  The most important are "Core" and "Mine".  The Core bin contains all standard parts, where families of similar parts are aggregated into one (e.g., the red LED stands for all the other colors). The Mine bin will contain your custom created parts.  </br>

							To search for a part, use the type-in field at the base of the parts bin palette.  This will match any word containing your typed-in text, so for example typing in "cap" will find all capacitors.  A search will bring up a Search bin containing all the parts matching your query.. More generally, though, as the software author, you are already covered by your country's copyright laws (assuming you've taken the steps for your work to be copyrighted; in the US, that's simply actually making the work).

							The NetBeans Platform is a generic framework for Swing applications. It provides the "plumbing" that, before, every developer had to write themselves—saving state, connecting actions to menu items, toolbar items and keyboard shortcuts; window management, and so on.

							The NetBeans Platform provides all of these out of the box. You don't need to manually code these or other basic features, yourself, anymore. See what some NetBeans-based applications look like. The platform does not add a lot of overhead to your application — but it can save a huge amount of time and work.
							The NetBeans Platform provides a reliable and flexible application architecture. Your application does not have to look anything like an IDE. It can save you years of development time. The NetBeans Platform gives you a time-tested architecture for free. An architecture that encourages sustainable development practices. Because the NetBeans Platform architecture is modular, it's easy to create applications that are robust and extensible.The NetBeans Platform provides a reliable and flexible application architecture.

							Based on the powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.</br>
							Notepad++ is a text editor and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows. It supports tabbed editing, which allows working with multiple open files in a single window. The project's name comes from the C increment operator.

							Notepad++ is distributed as free software. At first the project was hosted on SourceForge.net, from where it has been downloaded over 28 million times,[2][3] and twice won the SourceForge Community Choice Award for Best Developer Tool. The project was hosted on TuxFamily (fr) from 2010 to 2015; since 2015 Notepad++ has been hosted on GitHub.

							Visual Studio supports 36 different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service exists.Visual Studio does not support any programming language, solution or tool intrinsically; instead, it allows the plugging of functionality coded as a VSPackage.<br/>
							When installed, the functionality is available as a Service. The IDE provides three services: SVsSolution, which provides the ability to enumerate projects and solutions; SVsUIShell, which provides windowing and UI functionality (including tabs, toolbars and tool windows); and SVsShell, which deals with registration of VSPackages.Support for programming languages is added by using a specific VSPackage called a Language Service. A language service defines various interfaces which the VSPackage implementation can implement to add support for various functionalities.
