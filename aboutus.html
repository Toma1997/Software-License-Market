							<p>The report illustrates the fluidity of the software market place and the rapidly changing customer preferences dictating how software is bought and sold,” said Steve Schmidt, Vice President of Corporate Development at Flexera Software.  “To thrive in this environment producers must adopt an agile Software Monetization strategy and implement automation that flexibly supports multiple software pricing and licensing models.  As the data suggests, many producers are not yet ‘change-ready,’ and therefore are at risk. </br>

							The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derivative work can only be distributed under the same license terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.</br>

							Enterprises are rapidly redefining how they want to license and pay for business software.  Moreover, technology is shifting so rapidly it is rendering old pricing and licensing models obsolete,” said R “Ray" Wang, Principal Analyst & Founder at Constellation Research.  “Smart software producers are being proactive, viewing this dramatic shift as an opportunity to offer more flexible monetization models, capture market share and new revenue streams.
							The 2016 Key Trends in Software Pricing and Licensing survey was conducted by Flexera Software.  This annual research project looks at software licensing, pricing and enforcement trends and best practices.  The survey reaches out to executives at application producers (software vendors and intelligent device manufacturers) and enterprises who use and manage software and devices.  Now in its tenth year, the survey is made available to the industry at large each year.  Producers that fail to act risk being left behind.</p>

							The free software movement campaigns to win for the users of computing the freedom that comes from free software. Free software puts its users in control of their own computing. Non-free software puts its users under the power of the software's developer. See the video explanation.
							The name “GNU” is a recursive acronym for “GNU's Not Unix.” “GNU” is pronounced g'noo, as one syllable, like saying “grew” but replacing the r with n.<br/>
							In 1998 the term “open source” was coined and associated with views considerably different from ours. These views cite only the practical advantages of free software, and carefully avoid the deeper issues of freedom and social solidarity that the Free Software Movement raises.

							</br>The idea of open source is good as far as it goes, but it only scratches the surface of the issue.</br> We don't mind working with supporters of open source on practical activities such as software development, but we do not agree with their views, and we decline to operate under their name.</p>

							<p>The enterprise software marketplace is undergoing a massive transformation as the pricing and licensing models dictating how software is bought and sold evolve.  Fueled in part by shifts in customer demand and in part by rapidly changing technology, some application producers are poised to reap windfall profits from the new software pricing and licensing models emerging, while others risk being left behind.  This is the conclusion of a new report published by Software Monetization expert, Flexera Software.</br>

							Bliss or Ignorance? 73 percent of producers boast their pricing and licensing policies are effective.  Yet despite this confidence, 51 percent of those surveyed admitted they don’t track customer usage, 45 percent don’t audit customer usage, 55 percent don’t have technology in place to track customer usage of their products, and 42 percent say their customers have challenges determining which software products they’re entitled to use.</br>

							That said, it's hit or miss whether software licenses are legally enforceable, even if a lawyer wrote them (at least in the US, and it depends almost entirely on the whim of the judge or ruling copyright authority). More generally, though, as the software author, you are already covered by your country's copyright laws (assuming you've taken the steps for your work to be copyrighted; in the US, that's simply actually making the work).</p>
